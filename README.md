## My last projects
- "Semantically-Informed Regressive Encoder Score" submission for WMT23 Shared task workshop [ [Paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vFPDnpkXn_D0h8SmEppRUr9iv64dhKj9/view?usp=sharing) ] [ [Repo](https://github.com/v-vskv-v/WMT23-MRE-Score) ]
  - Our task was to develop NN-based metric for text evaluation(machine translation)
  - We improved our developments from AIRI research project trying different approaches(including use of additional vector representations and contrastive learning)
  - Our approach was on 5th place in chinese-english and hebrew-english language pairs and 11th on english-german language pair
  - Our paper was reviewed and we were invited to EMNLP 23 conference
- Team submission for Eval4NLP Shared task workshop [ [Paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wKsQRCB8kf1UrKdEzSYDKqreIRVPk2UM/view?usp=sharing) ] [ [Repo](https://github.com/Rexhaif/retrieval-augmented-score) ]
  - Our task was to develop metric for text evaluation(MT&Summarization) only using prompt-engineering techniques and approaches
  - We tried the new approach based on AutoMQM work
  - Our paper was reviewed and we were invited to IJCNLP-AACL 23 conference
- "Efficient LLM-based metrics for NLG" research project for AIRI Summer School [ [Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1HNTf9DLWdZIoHxJs9yREJllIuufMsnpHGo9o_seEV_s/edit) ] [ [Repo](https://github.com/Rexhaif/airi_summer_llm_metrics) ]
  - Our task was to develop NN-based metric for text evaluation(machine translation)
  - We tried to beat GPT4-based GEMBA metric by fine-tuning LLMs for translation evaluation
  - I implemented LLM Encoder+MLP decoder architecture which got the best quality
- "Multimodality in image2text tasks" research project for 1st year of HSE [ [Poster](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_b7Yyl43Ck0212e8oj2vRu3GoVxk9pfwi9Ok_85I9xk/edit#slide=id.p1) ] [ [Repo](https://github.com/Technolog796/image_captioning) ]
  - Our task was to develop image2text model for russian language
  - We implemented the BLIP-2 architecture and tested it on various configurations
  - We adapted architecture for russian language and achieved tolerable quality
- NTI ML contest, 2021 [ [Repo](https://github.com/Egoluback/nti_ml_20-21) ]
  - I used lots of classic ML algorithms(linear and logistic regression, trees, boostings, etc), web-scrapping for data extraction and grid-search for hyperparams search
  - We achieved one of the best scores in final rating
- Toxic detector bot, pet project [ [Repo](https://github.com/Egoluback/Toxic_Detector) ]
  - I trained CatBoostClassifiers for toxicity prediction using word2vec embeddings
- Other pet-projects
